<h3>WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/paw2.png">    The English Bulldog Rescue is a volunteer group whose mission is to rehab and re-home neglected, 
abused and unwanted English Bulldogs. We also provide a safe alternative to shelters 
for owners that are faced with the decision to find a new home for their bulldog.<br><br>

<img src="images/paw2.png"> We rely solely on donations to finance veterinary exams, inoculations, medications and surgeries, as well as the daily feeding and care that our rescued dogs need while in our care.<br><br>

<img src="images/paw2.png"> Florida English Bulldog Rescue has been helping this wonderful breed since 2020. We are a small group of volunteers with a huge love for the bulldog. We are a 501(c)3 organization, 
that has helped over 1000 bulldogs and that number is growing. We give each bulldog that enters our program 100% care and rehab so that it has the best chance at a 
quality life in a forever home. </p>
